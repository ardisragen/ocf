# Purpose

AMsoil is a light-weight framework for creating Aggregate Managers (AM) for test beds.
AMsoil is a pluggable system. It provides the necessary glue between RPC-Handlers and Resource Managers .
Also it provides helpers for common tasks in AM development.

AMsoil is part of the [OFELIA](http://www.fp7-ofelia.eu/) [Control Framework (OCF)](https://github.com/fp7-ofelia).

If you don't know what an Aggregate Manager is please see [here](https://alpha.fp7-ofelia.eu/doc/index.php/General_terminology).
