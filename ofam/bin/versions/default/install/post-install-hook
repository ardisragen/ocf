printHeader "info#" "Make sure port 3626 is reachable by experimenters (i.e. isn't blocked by network firewalls, iptables, etc). In case of problems, first check the log files under $SRC_DIR/local/log, especially the foam.log. If needed, rerunning the installation script (after pulling the latest git bug-fixes) will fix most major issues (and no other steps are required from your side)."
