    - Opt-in and Opt-out tests work now.
    - One bug in Opt-out view fixed.

    Known Issues:
    - Need to enable certificate verification by default for 
      PasswordXMLRPCServerProxy
    - Some Opt-In Manager tests still fail because of missing cookies
    - Permissions need to be applied
    - Any URL that redirects to the rpc4django view can be used to 
      access any xml-rpc call.
    - GAPI for OpenFlow is a bit hackish and should be made more 
      seamless. This requires finishing the permission system and 
      separating RPC calls by URL.
    - Permission system missing middleware to redirect to permission URL
    - Documentation is lacking horribly.
    - install.sh script still has the bugs from 0.0.1-alpha1
