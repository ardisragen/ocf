	OFELIA provides two sources of help. On one side, there is the OFELIA User Documentation. This wiki gathers all the required information about the facility and how to work with the OFELIA Control Framework from an experimenter point of view. On the other side, OFELIA Help desk is meant to provide experimenters a way to report and open trouble tickets if they found themselves in a situation where the OFELIA User Documentation is not enought.
