GENILight
--------
GENIlight is the flavor of the GENI wrapper code customized for
Enterprise GENI. This page provides patches, code and interface files
required for setting up GENIlight.

What
----
This is an attempt to provide a light-weight, language independent, SOAP
interface between the GENI clearing house (i.e., slice manager) and an
aggregate manager.

How
---
* Specify a formal SOAP protocol specification, i.e., a WSDL
* Create a python stub on the slice manager that translates the
  GeniClient interface into SOAP. The stub also performs NOOPs for GENI
  calls that do not apply to Enterprise-GENI
* Per aggregate manager, specify which interface they prefer to use 

Installation
------------
1. Grab GENI wrapper code if you don't have it
    * svn co http://svn.planet-lab.org/svn/geniwrapper/trunk 
2. Install python-suds
    * If you are building the skeleton aggregate manager, you will also
    * need SOAPlib for python2.5
3. Download GENI light tarball
4. cd geniwrapper/geni/ directory
    * tar xvfz genilight.tar.gz
